# Mixed_Cell_Cellullar_Automata
The Mixed-Cell Cellullar Automata (MCCA) provides a new approach to enable more dynamic mixed landuse modeling to move away from the analysis of static patterns.  One of the biggest advantages of mixed-cell CA models is the capability of simulating the quantitative and continuous changes of multiple landuse components inside cells, while pure-cell CA models can only simulate the qualitative and discrete change of landuse at the cell level. Therefore, mixed-cell CA models are able to simulate subtle changes in landuse structures caused by minor variations of socio-economic, eco-environmental and political driving factors, providing a detailed perspective for understanding landuse change process.
